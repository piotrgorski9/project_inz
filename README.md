# Web Application for Polish Emigration Analysis

The primary goal of this project was to develop a web application that allows users to easily conduct analysis on the emigration of Poles abroad. The project began with a thorough market analysis to identify similar applications, understand what they offer, and find unique features to incorporate into the developed application. 

From this research, key insights were drawn, and the application was planned to provide users with two main features:
1. **Overview of Popular Emigration Destinations** – A detailed insight into countries that are popular among Polish emigrants.
2. **Statistical Analysis** – The application allows users to conduct basic statistical analyses on emigration data.

The most crucial functionality of the application revolves around data analysis. To enhance the analysis features, additional market research was conducted to gather essential formulas, which were later implemented into the application. In addition, the ability to generate graphs from the database was introduced, significantly improving the visual presentation of results.

The analysis is available in two formats:
- **Full Analysis** for registered users.
- **Basic Analysis** for unregistered users, offering a simplified version of the analysis with basic formulas to encourage account creation.

Another key feature for all users is the ability to browse basic information about countries included in the database. Users can select a country from a dropdown menu and view relevant details on the page.

In summary, the application was designed to facilitate the analysis of Polish emigration trends in an accessible, fast, and enjoyable manner. By consolidating all necessary features in one place, users can easily conduct comprehensive analyses, making the application both efficient and user-friendly for everyone.
